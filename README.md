# Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition

This project uses the `face-api.js` library to implement real-time face detection, recognition, and analysis using a webcam feed. The application captures video from the user's camera and analyzes faces in real-time.

## Features:
- **Face Detection**: Identifies and locates faces in the video feed.
- **Face Recognition**: Compares detected faces to a reference image (e.g., Michael Jordan) and labels them accordingly.
- **Age & Gender Estimation**: Provides predictions about the detected person's age and gender.
- **Emotion Detection**: Analyzes facial expressions to identify emotions like happiness, sadness, or surprise.
- **Real-Time Display**: Visual feedback is provided by drawing bounding boxes, facial landmarks, and other data on an HTML canvas overlaying the video feed.

## Use Cases:
- Personal security
- Emotion tracking
- Interactive, emotion-aware applications
